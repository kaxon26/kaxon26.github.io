        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This is a sample of the different types of writing I've done throughout my time at UMass.
            It includes technical, professional, and creative writing, as well as web design samples
            and my Honors college thesis.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Writing</h2>
        <h3>A Novelist's Guide to Microsoft Word <a href="/portfolio/axon_manual.pdf">(PDF)</a></h3>
        <p>
            Through the process of creating this manual, I learned the principles of technical writing and software
            documentation. I also gained experience doing user testing, applying design principles, and using
            Microsoft Word. This manual is directed at novelists who do not have familiarity with Word, and it
            contains modules explaining how to use different features of Word.
        </p>

        <h3>MadCap Flare Accessibilty Guide (<a href="/portfolio/finalflarepdf.pdf">PDF</a> or
            <a href="https://people.umass.edu/kaxon/flare/Content/Home.htm">web</a>).
        </h3>
        <p>
            This guide, created using MadCap Flare, provides an introduction to web accessibility for
            digital content creators. It includes chapters on digital accessibility in general,
            how to use alt text, and how to use closed captioning. The cover and logo were designed using Adobe Illustrator, and
            the final project was output in both web and pdf format.
        </p>

        <h2>Grant Writing</h2>
            <h3>After-School ELL Faux Grant <a href="/portfolio/grant.pdf">(PDF)</a></h3>
            <p>
                This faux grant was created as the final project for a professional writing class.
                It seeks funding for the creation of an afterschool ELL program in Holyoke, MA.
                This project involved research and learning the structure of a grant. It was created in
                Microsoft Word.
            </p>

        <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <h3>
                391C Intro to Web Design Exercises <a href="https://people.umass.edu/kaxon/exercises/index.html">(web)</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                These exercises were created as a part of the class Intro to Web Design, a part of the
                Professional Writing and Technical Communication program at UMass. Through these exercises
                I learned how to use HTML and CSS, how to troubleshoot, and how to implement basic principles of design.
                These exercises built to a final portfolio website.
            </p>

        <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
        <h3>
            The Bees, Jabberwocky <a href="/portfolio/jabberwocky.pdf">(PDF)</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is a creative writing story that was written as a part of a creative writing workshop and
            published in the UMass undergraduate literary magazine Jabberwocky.
        </p>

        <h2>Thesis</h2>
        <h3>
            Silence as Gender <a href="/portfolio/silenceasgender.pdf">(PDF)</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            As the capstone thesis for the UMass Honors College, I completed a yearlong thesis in which I examined
            themes of gender and language in the 13th century French poem, the Roman de Silence.
